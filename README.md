# tiny-assembler
A tiny assembler built to learn about assemblers.

## Usage
The assembler targets intel 8080 and Z80 instruction sets (as Z80 is an extension/superset of the intel 8080 instruction set). Opcode table can be found [here](https://pastraiser.com/cpu/i8080/i8080_opcodes.html).

A test program (written by [Brian Callahan](https://briancallahan.net/)) is included `hello.com`.

To compile and run tests run `run.sh`.

Currently only the disassembler has been written.
